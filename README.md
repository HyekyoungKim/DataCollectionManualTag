POSTECH CSED499II Research Project II

The goal of this project is to improve the performance of indoor positioning system using geomagnetic field by applying recurrent neural network to the localizing step.

This repository includes the data collection step for constructing geomagnetic map. The next step appears in https://github.com/HyekyoungKim/Geomagnetic_IPS_using_RNN.
